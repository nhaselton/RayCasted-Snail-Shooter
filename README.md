# RayCasted-Snail-Shooter
This was a small game i made over my spring vacation because i was curious how raycasting works and wanted to try it myself 

NOTE:
for a standalone build you have to add the res folder into the same folder as the .exe

A few things about this
1) its written with no external libraries, it uses windows.h for the window
2) for the ammo counter instead of having an image per digit, I made a 7 segment display so it could all be done via code
3) This was made because I wanted to improve at C and I wanted to learn about raycasting
